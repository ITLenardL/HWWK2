# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Tasked to create files and formatted with bootstrap and css stylesheet to replicate 3 pages index, portfolio & contact. 
<br>These should include a navigation bar with button links to each other.

# HWWK2

The aim is to create a portfolio with a navigation bar linking all the pages together.
<br>index - about me page featuring a profile picture and short blurb. 
<br>portfolio - this page was to feature works that had previously been done in a gallery style format.
<br>contact - this is a proforma contact page which was able to be filled in and had buttons that interact.
These 3 pages were to be done in using bootstrap html and having our own stylesheet css for any additional editing we would like to add.

# Problems
Issues I ran into were learning what commands bootstrap had in its library and how they were to be written. There was many hours spent copying a template of code and just destroying it bit by bit to work out what different pieces did. That said, some formatting was unable to be made exactly like the examples given and will require further knowledge or research.

Structure:
    <br>Html files index, portfolio & contact in root folder
    <br>Css style sheet located in root folder as well
